*Fig: Overview of our analyses. (A) We generated multi-antigen images for 69 skin tissue samples from 21 CTCL, 23 AD, and 25 PSO patients. Subsequently, images were pre-processed via cell segmentation, cell-level protein abundance quantification, and cell type assignment. (B) We then computed spatial graph representations for all samples, which we analyzed using SquidPy as well as different heterogeneity scores implemented in our Python package SHouT: local and global entropy, local and global homophily, and egophily.*
