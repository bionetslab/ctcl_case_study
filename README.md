# About

This is a repository that contains information on how to reproduce results corresponding to the *cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL)* case study reported in [Link text Here](https://paper-doi-when-available).

# Data

Complete data available publicly over [Zenodo](data-link).

# Installation

Install conda environment as follows (there also exists a requirements.txt)
```bash
conda create --name ctcl_case_study
conda activate ctcl_case_study
pip install scipy==1.10.1 numpy==1.23.5 squidpy==1.3.0 pandas==1.5.3 scikit-learn==1.2.2
```
*Note:* Additionally, modules *math* and *statistics* were used, however no installation is required as they are provided with Python by default.



# HPA-based cell type assignment

## Steps involved:

Install conda environment as follows (there also exists a requirements.txt)
```bash
conda create --name ctcl_case_study
conda activate ctcl_case_study
pip install scipy==1.10.1 numpy==1.23.5 squidpy==1.3.0 pandas==1.5.3 scikit-learn==1.2.2
```
*Note:* Additionally, modules *math* and *statistics* were used, however no installation is required as they are provided with Python by default.

## Running the code:

Navigate  to */scripts/plots\_for\_paper/fig2\_database/* and run **fig2\_database.py**. Plot saved as *fig2\_database.pdf*.

*Note:* Additionally, modules *math* and *statistics* were used, however no installation is required as they are provided with Python by default.

## Output:



# CTCL case study for the SHouT python package
